In many real-world applications—especially in healthcare, finance, and policy—model transparency and interpretability are equally critical.\n\nAfter training your models using the `fastml()` function, you can gain deeper insights into how your models make decisions using the `fastexplain()` function. This function offers a suite of visual and quantitative tools to help you:\n\n- Interpret model predictions on a per-observation basis,\n\n- Assess global feature importance,\n\n- Understand the direction and magnitude of each feature's influence,\n\n- Identify potential biases or instability in the model's logic.\n\nUnlike black-box models that offer little explanation, `fastexplain()` provides interpretable outputs that are especially valuable in high-stakes domains where accountability matters.\n\nUnder the hood, `fastexplain()` is powered by the excellent **`DALEX`** package, enabling consistent, model-agnostic explanations across a wide range of algorithms—including tree-based models, linear models, boosting methods, and support vector machines.\n\nIn this tutorial, you’ll learn how to:\n\n- Create explainers from trained fastml objects,\n\n- Visualize feature importance using permutation methods,\n\n- Interpret SHAP values to understand individual predictions,\n\n- Explore optional parameters to fine-tune explanations.\n\n\n`fastexplain()` helps to answer questions such as:\n\n-   Which features are the most important for model prediction?\n-   How do features affect the predicted outcome?\n-   Are model predictions stable or sensitive to small changes in input?\n\n# Usage\n\n``` r\nexplanation <- fastexplain(result, type = \"full\")\n```\n\n### Key Arguments:\n\n-   `object`: The output object from `fastml()`.\n\n-   `type`: Type of explanation.
